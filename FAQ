CRISP can run in two modes: --EM 0 and --EM 1 option 

--EM 0 corresponds to the original CRISP method that uses the contingency table analysis and per pool filters
to identify variant sites and report allele frequencies for each pool 

--EM 1 corresponds to the new CRISP method that can estimate the 'discrete' pooled genotype for each pool
and uses a likelihood ratio test (in addition to the contingency table analysis) to call variants. This is 
recommended for artificial pooled sequencing studies. 



1. If you get a segmentation fault while running CRISP, try to compile CRISP from the source code 
on your system.

2. CRISP requires at least two pools to make variant calls, but at least 5 pools are ideal
3. The reference sequence file should be indexed using 'samtools faidx' or a similar program and placed in same directory as fasta file with extension .fai
5. For human re-sequencing, if a bedfile is not specified, the program will evaluate each base for variant calling and the output log file can be huge
6. Please set the quality value offset correctly: 33 for quality values encoded in Sanger format and 64 for Illumina 1.3+ format. Setting this value incorrectly can result in significant overcalling/undercalling of variants. Default is 33
7. Please make sure that the reference sequence file is the same as the one used to align the reads in the BAM files and that the BAM files are coordinate sorted
8. For indel analysis, CRISP assumes that indels are left justified, --leftalign 1 option can be used to left justify gaps in aligned reads
9. the program uses the samtools API for reading bam files 
10. BAM files should be indexed in order to use the --regions option with the indexed bam file as pooln.bam.bai

11. The aligned reads for each pool should be in a single bam file that is sorted by chromosomal coordinates
12. The ctpval and qvpval thresholds are only used with EM = 0 option (older version of CRISP)
